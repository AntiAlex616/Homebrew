		<requirements />
		<description>
			<p>You've trained since a young age to not only master a Keyblade but to use magic to aid you in your adventures.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>Is this needed? Could be used for abilities? Sonic Blade, Ragnarok etc.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Fire and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Fire using either slot.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Keyspells spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Keyspells table shows when you learn more Keyspells spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Keyspells you know and replace it with another spell from the Keyspells spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Keyspells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to project your will into the world. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Keyspell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<p class="indent">Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			<p class="indent">Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>A Keyblade, or any weapon enhanced with a Keychain, can be used as a spellcasting focus for all kinds of spells.</p>
